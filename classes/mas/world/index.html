        Inspired by NetLogo's Grand Canyon Model. The aim of the model is to
        show how data in the form of a elevation, can be used as a foundation of
        a simple spatial agent-based model. Similar to the Netlogo model, the
        elevation data comes from the National Elevation Dataset. It was
        converted from an ESRI Grid into an ASCII grid file using ArcGIS.
        <p>
        Similar to Sillypeds, the elevation data acts as our terrain, in this
        case its Crater Lake in Oregon. Agents within the model (in this case
        water) fall at random over the terrain and then flows downhill over the
        terrain. If the water cannot flow downhill, it pools up and once the
        gradient is sufficient, the water flows. For example, water falling in
        Crater Lake, initially has to pool up until the water level is sufficient
        to breach the caldera. Once this occurs water flows out of the lake.
